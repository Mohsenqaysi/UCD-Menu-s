## Distributed System Project:
- [The link provide a mocky JSON data similar to what the API looks like](http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a2afe432d0000162d91b28f).
- The aim was to develop a front iOS App that uses a back-end API using RESTful-API with Actors (Akka) to manage the services on the back end to show UCD Restaurant's Daily Menus.
